# Binary Compression Algorithm

Code to compress files after analyzing their contents to create optimal character/binary pairs using a binary search tree and priority queue.
To use:
- Clone the repo.
- Put input txt files in an INPUTS folder, next to the repo folder, and make blank txt files in an OUTPUTS file beside that folder. Hierarchy should look like:

--PARENT

----INPUTS

------inputfile.txt

----OUTPUTS

------inputfileCompressed.txt

------inputfileDecompressed.txt

- Rename target file to your own file in MyCompression.java
- Run MyCompression.java
